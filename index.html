<h1>Welcome.</h1>
My name is Florian and I am currently a PhD student with the <a href="https://iis.ee.ethz.ch/">Integrated Systems Laboratory</a> of <a href="https://www.ethz.ch/en">ETH Zurich</a>. My research interest include the design of very large scale integration circuits with particular focus on application specific integrated circuits and their applications in high performance computing.
